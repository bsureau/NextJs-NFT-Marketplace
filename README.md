# NFT Marketplace

This is the frontend part of NFT Marketplace project, using The Graph indexer.

> The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible. It uses GraphQL and is a more decentralized solution compared to Moralis. 

### Run the project

Note: You'll first need to create a subgraph on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/studio/). Then just follow the given documentation instructions once you've created your subgraph.

```bash
yarn install # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env # Create your .env file
yarn dev # Start local server
```
